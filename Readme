-- About

This program allows you to create and run Logo scripts on your TI-Nspire (TM) calculator.
Logo is an educational language, suitable for all ages. Its used many times to introduce computer programming to people.
Because of this, Logo is many times mistankly seen as very simple, while its quite complex, and equal to any other language.


-- Usage

When you open the script, you will notice two tabs, one with the Launcher, and one with the editor.
Use ctrl + left/right to navigate between them.

To launch a script (first tab), you select it in the list and press enter. Execution should start right away.
Please note that some scripts might take a time to run, as they are interpreted in an interpreted language.

To edit a script or create a new one, navigate to the seccond tab. Choose "New script..." to create a new script, or any other option to edit an existing script.
The editor will appear. Navigation through the editor is very simple (arrow keys), and to save your script just press "escape". 

-- Key's

Switch between editor and launcher : ctrl + left/right
Launch/Edit a script : Enter

Navigate in editor : up/down/left/right
Insert tab : Tab
